Draft note: 

The server will be a Ruspberry Pi 4 model B, installed at home, running Linux Debian. It will actually run Docker containers, of which there will be about 3-4: back-end, front-end, infra, and postgres. I'll create my own custom Docker image and upload it to Docker Hub; the link will be here later.
